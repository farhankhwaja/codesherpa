## 2026-07-04 — Phase 1 — indexing throughput (worktree core-index, pre-merge)

Benchmark: `python tests/bench_indexing.py` (synthetic fixture-class Py+TS
corpus, cold sync = parse + chunk + store, CPU-only, Apple Silicon; line-window
chunker — Phase 2 re-measures with tree-sitter cAST).

| corpus | LOC | cold sync | throughput | warm sync (no new blobs) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 400 modules | 18,200 | 0.096 s | 189,338 LOC/s | 0.018 s |
| 1,000 modules | 45,500 | 0.227 s | 200,836 LOC/s | 0.041 s |

Target ≥ 2,000 LOC/s: **PASS** (~100×).
